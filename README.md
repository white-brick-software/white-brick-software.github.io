# Whitebrick Solutions

When I started dreaming of writing and selling my own software, I knew I would have to have a name and a URL for my organization.  Coming up with a unique domain name that had some version of my name in it turned out to be fairly difficult.  "Whitebricksoftware.com" was the first domain name I could think of that wasn't already taken.  I kind of like it, because the room in my current house that I use as my computer room has a wall with a fireplace surrounded by bricks painted white.

We stopped using this domain for a long time.  When we decided to start up the business again, we wanted to be able to provide other services besides just software, so we changed the name to Whitebrick Solutions.  (I would have called it "White Brick Solutions" instead of "Whitebrick Solutions", but my wife applied for the business license, and we hadn't discussed the specifics beforehand, so...)
